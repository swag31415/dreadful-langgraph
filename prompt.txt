# The Party at the End of the World
## A Dread One-Shot Scenario

### 🏰 The Setting
A mysterious, enchanted mansion deep in an unmapped forest. The structure is alive - walls breathe, rooms rearrange themselves, and magic pulses through its ancient stones. At its heart stands a massive blue horse statue that seems to change position when no one is looking.

### 🎭 The Premise
You've all received an unusual invitation:
"Attend the gathering. Wear something festive. Come with no expectations. There will be food, laughter, and a game you won't forget."

The party has begun. The music has stopped. The lights are flickering.
And now you can't leave.

### 🔮 Key Features
- A sentient, shifting mansion that reacts to its guests
- A giant blue horse statue with glowing red eyes
- Rooms that move, disappear, or become mirror images of themselves
- Magic residue that responds to emotion and fear
- Temperature that's always slightly wrong

### 🏛️ Notable Locations
- The Dining Hall: An endless banquet, still steaming but untouched
- The Shifting Library: Where books whisper and one bleeds
- The Training Hall: Scorched and dented, filled with old echoes
- The Mirror Room: Where reflections aren't quite right
- The Underground Hot Spring: Abandoned... or not
- The Blue Horse Courtyard: Home to the unsettling statue
